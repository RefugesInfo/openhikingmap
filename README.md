# OpenHikingMap
OpenHikingMap is a mapnik 3.x+ map style using Openstreetmap data for moutain activities and specifically Alpine hut and sleeping places in the mountains.

The official information page is here : https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenHikingMap

Missing external files can be found :

== geotiff files for relief, contours pg dump and Water Areas shapefiles ==

This still uses pre-compiled or data not from OpenStreetMap
You can get the one I'm using here : https://maps.refuges.info/download

But of course you can build your own colored or not & shaded or not relief

== water polygons ==
